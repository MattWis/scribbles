title: Public Domain Me Post Mortem
---
After my death, all my work should be public domain.

Although I don't know what I will achieve in life, I am pretty sure that it would be a good idea to have my work free for every one to use after my death. I won't profit from it anymore anyway, so why not be kind and let the following generations use my work?
