I know it sounds crazy, but that's what crazy ideas are about. It may be possible to break the adhesion of a new (imaginary) kind of glue by energizing the glued materials using specific microwaves or some other non-fatal radiation. This way one may develop a glue that can be quite strong but also easily removed.

I came up with the idea when I saw earlier this week that the ear tips of my in-ear headphones are becoming kind of loose and I was going to lose another pair if I wouldn't glue it in some way.
