title: Symbol Pronounciation

> [...] each glyph has its own monosyllabic name, designed to be pronounced quickly in combination with another glyph to form a rune name. As languages are often read-aloud, this saves the programmer from having to say "dollar sign, question mark"--"bucwut" is much more compact.

> Because Hoon uses ASCII symbols so heavily (there is some resemblance to Perl or even the APL family, although Hoon is more regular than both), it presents a serious vocalization problem. To aid in speaking Hoon – both for actual communication, and to assist in subvocalized reading – we have our own one-syllable names for ASCII tokens
