Sometimes I have these dreams where I have to achieve something and when I fail to do so I am set back to some other point in time. At first I thought I dreamt of some video game but then I realized it was actually common for my dreams to happen in non-linear and non-coherent time.

Anyway, I got the idea to write a story sometime that is set in a dimension or place where various timelines and chains of possibilities are mixed up and not as coherent as in our reality.
