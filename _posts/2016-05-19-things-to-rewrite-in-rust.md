title: Things to rewrite in Rust
---

Some people wrote posts about stuff they want to see rewritten in Rust[^1], but that's not this is about. I want to rewrite stuff in Rust to learn more Rust, learn more about the projects and their fields, and, well, just for fun.

[^1]: For example: libpng, musl, life, the Linux kernel, the universe, everything.

## A list of probably interesting things

- [Butteraugli](https://github.com/google/butteraugli) – a tool for measuring differences between images (C++, [Go port](https://github.com/jasonmoo/go-butteraugli))
- [FLIF](https://github.com/FLIF-hub/FLIF) – Free Lossless Image Format (C++)
  - FLIF's "Maniac" encoding ([part](https://github.com/FLIF-hub/FLIF/tree/0f0041079dba5195ea88235ba6ff1656b16dfc47/src/maniac) of FLIF's repo)
- [story-graph](https://github.com/incrediblesound/story-graph) – The Graph that Generates Stories (JavaScript)
- A virtual DOM thingy with adaptors for libui and CLI [as described in this note]({% post_url 2016-07-23-impl-virtual-dom-cli-libui %})
